# MacOS Virtual Media Keys

The media keys on the Touch Bar like, don't work. Install these Services and add global keyboard shortcuts for them.

## Installation
1. Clone this repository
2. Copy the `.workflow` directories into ~/Library/Services/
3. Open System Preferences > Keyboard > Shortcuts
4. Select "Services" in the sidebar
5. Find the new services in the list (Under "General")
6. Add whatever shortcut you want. Note that any application-level shortcuts will override these shortcuts, so your new shortcuts must be unique to work in any app.

## Troubleshooting
If your shortcut isn't working, open the "Services" menu item and make sure the services and shortcuts are correct.

Not all applications have a "Services" menu. The shortcuts will not work in those applications.
